Progress week 4

Previously we had our login screen and signup button and we created an activity where user could provide required information to signup for the app. We also created a search bar that allowed user to search for services that are currently being offer on the app. 

For this week, we decided to add one more screen once the user login. They now have an option to search for services or creat a seller profile. If they hit creat a seller profile it takes them to second activity where we ask their details. We decided to ask them for their business name, services they offer, location (zip code) and lastly any other details they would like to display on their profile. Every user will only be able to creat one seller profile. 


Work distribution
For this week I(Abhi) and Azhar were responsible for doing the main activity and added the buttons also linked them to their respective activity. Tahir was responsible for visually creating the activities on a piece of paper. He drew out his idea for them and abhi and I were able to implement that in android studio. I would say we successfully achieved what we had plan for this week and our app is almost finished as far as the design goes.
