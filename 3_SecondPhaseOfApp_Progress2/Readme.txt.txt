Progress week2

Previously we had our login screen and signup button. For this week, we created a signup activity that is linked to our signup button on our login screen. We asked user for their first name last name email. We also had them make a user name and password for an easy log in process next time around. We added a submit button which accepts all the inputs and makes the user account. Also when they click the submit button they go on the next activity which is where they can decide if they want to search for a service or make a seller profile. We are looking to work on seller profile perspective of the app this week.
